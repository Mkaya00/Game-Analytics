### Distribution analysis of game numbers by year

The chart of game numbers from 1980 to 2020 clearly
shows the evolution of the video game industry, with 
significant increases and decreases in game numbers
over time. These fluctuations reflect technological
developments, market changes, and the influence of
various gaming platforms.

**1980-1991: Early Stages and Fluctuations**

Between 1980 and 1991, there were noticeable fluctuations
in game numbers. During this period, the video game
industry was still in its infancy, and it faced several
economic and technological challenges. 

The 1983 Video Game Crash significantly impacted the
industry, causing the collapse of many small game
companies and leading to a sharp decline in game numbers.

However, after the crash, the industry started
to recover, and the release of Nintendo’s NES in
1985 contributed to a gradual increase in game 
numbers. Despite this, the market and technology
were still immature, which led to fluctuating increases
and decreases in game numbers.

As the early 1990s approached, the release of
portable consoles and new-generation consoles,
particularly the Super Nintendo Entertainment 
System (SNES), contributed to an increase in game numbers.

**1991-2009: Rapid Growth and Peak Years**

From 1991 to 2009, there was a clear and consistent 
upward trend in game numbers. During this period, the
industry grew rapidly, and many major platforms 
and consoles were released.

Starting from the late 1990s, the release of
consoles like PlayStation 2 and Nintendo DS 
had a major impact on game numbers, accelerating 
the growth of the industry. These consoles 
offered game developers new opportunities to
create games in various genres.

The years 2008 and 2009 saw a peak in game numbers.
The industry experienced a boom, with many
popular games and platforms catering to a broader
audience. These years represent a period of
significant growth, with a sharp rise in game numbers.

**Post-2009: Decline and New Challenges**

After 2009, there was a noticeable decline in game numbers. Several factors may explain this decline:

The Complexity and Length of Game Development:

Game development processes became more complex and time-consuming, especially with the production of high-budget, high-quality games. After the peak in 2008-2009, the time and resources required to develop these games may have slowed down the production speed, leading to a decrease in the number of games released.

Data Set Limitations: 

As digital game sales grew, older datasets typically only reflected physical sales. This could explain the decline in the chart, as digital sales, especially on PS4 and PC platforms, became more widespread but were not adequately captured in the datasets.

**Conclusion**

The changes in game numbers between 1980 and 2020 reflect the development of the video game industry and the technological advancements that shaped it. The late 1980s and early 1990s marked the period when video games began to gain popularity and platforms diversified. The years 2008-2009 represented the peak of the gaming industry, driven by new-generation consoles and the rise of digital gaming. However, after this peak, the complexity of game development and limitations in data collection led to a decline in game numbers.

This analysis highlights key milestones in the gaming industry’s development and provides insights into the factors behind the rise and fall of game numbers over time.
