### Game Genre Sales Analysis

**Description**

This program allows the user to analyze the sales
of video games by genre over the years. It prompts
the user to input a specific game genre, and then
it generates a line graph showing the number 
of games in that genre sold each year, based
on available data.

**How It Works**

The program asks the user to input the name of a
video game genre (e.g., Action, Adventure, RPG, etc.).
Based on the provided genre, the program filters the data to 
focus on games that fall under the selected genre.
It then creates a line graph representing the number
of games in that genre sold for each year from the dataset.
The graph is generated using Python’s data
visualization libraries (e.g., Matplotlib, Seaborn)
to provide a clear and visual representation of 
the sales trends.

**Features**

User-friendly interface for genre selection.
Dynamic line graph generation based on user input.
Data visualization of sales trends for the selected genre over multiple years.
Allows for easy exploration of the popularity of different game genres over time.

Required libraries: matplotlib, pandas, seaborn

**How to Use**

	1.	Run the program.
	2.	Enter a valid video game genre when prompted.
