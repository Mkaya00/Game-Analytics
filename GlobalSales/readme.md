### Analysis Global Sale by Year
This line graph shows the annual changes in video
game sales from 1980 to 2020. From the 1980s to 
the 1990s, sales generally increased as the video
game industry grew, and interest in gaming consoles
and PC games expanded.

From the early 2000s to 2010, there was a sharp
increase in game sales. During this period, video
games became accessible to a broader audience, and
the release of new-generation consoles, along with
the rise of digital distribution platforms and 
online gaming, contributed to the peak in sales.
Particularly in the mid-2000s, the growth of 
digital platforms significantly boosted sales 
figures.

However, after 2010, the graph shows a
decline in sales. This decrease may be attributed
to data gaps in the dataset. For instance, missing
data for some years or the failure to capture
changes in the market could have contributed 
to the downward trend. Additionally, the popularity
of console and PC games may have slightly
decreased, while mobile gaming rose, which
might have affected the overall sales numbers.
