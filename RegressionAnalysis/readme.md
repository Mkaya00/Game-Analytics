### Analysis: Regression Between Year and Global Sales

This analysis examines the relationship between the release year of video games and their total global sales.

Each dot on the scatter plot represents a single video game, showing its release year (x-axis) and corresponding global sales (y-axis).  
The black regression line illustrates the overall trend across all data points.

The distribution of dots suggests that there is no strong linear relationship between the year of release and global sales.  
Global sales fluctuate across years without a consistent upward or downward trend.

This indicates that factors such as game quality, marketing, and genre have a stronger impact on sales than just the release year


### Additional Observations:

The data points are widely scattered, indicating that the release year alone does not strongly predict global sales.

Some years show exceptionally high sales, likely driven by the release of blockbuster titles.

There is no consistent growth trend over the years, suggesting that the industryâ€™s success is influenced by hit games rather than gradual yearly increases.

Major sales spikes are often tied to the launch of very successful titles.

Factors such as game quality, marketing strategy, and platform availability have a stronger impact on global sales than just the year of release.
